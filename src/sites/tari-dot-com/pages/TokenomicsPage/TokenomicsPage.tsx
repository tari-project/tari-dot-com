                    It is a rallying cry as poignant as it is timeless. Of course, the inquisitors can expect a blunt
                    and enthusiastic &quot;soon!&quot; in response. But this isn&apos;t an article about
                    &quot;Wen;&quot; it is an article about How. The time has come to reveal the details of Tari
                    tokenomics.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Big Picture:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let&apos;s get down to brass tacks. The Tari network has two layers: layer 1 (aka the Minotari
                    network) and layer 2 (aka the Ootle network). Layer 1 is secured by proof of work. Miners are
                    rewarded with Minotari tokens (XTM). Layer 2 is a Byzantine fault-tolerant network fueled by the
                    Tari token (XTR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be a total supply of 21 billion XTM emitted gradually using an exponential decay function
                    over approximately 27.8 years. Once annual emissions decline to 1% of total supply, a perpetual 1%
                    tail emission will continue indefinitely, ensuring ongoing miner compensation and network security.
                    Of this total supply, 6.3 billion XTM (30%) will be pre-mined, subject to significant lockups and
                    vesting schedules. These pre-mined tokens will support protocol infrastructure, community
                    incentives, grants, and long-term alignment with contributors. After the pre-mine distribution, all
                    newly emitted tokens (100%) will go exclusively to miners who secure the Tari network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a deep relationship between XTM tokens and XTR tokens. The only way to create XTR is to
                    burn XTM 1:1. A transaction fee-oriented burn mechanism on the Ootle network will help ensure
                    overall token supply equilibrium. There is much to cover, so let&apos;s start with the Tari Layer 1
                    proof of work model and XTM.&nbsp;

                    <span>
                        Once considered the gold standard for securing blockchains, proof of work originated with
                        Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs implementation for Bitcoin. Recently, it‚Äôs fallen out of favor for proof of
                        stake consensus mechanisms. We strongly believe that in the coming months, there will be a
                        renewed appreciation for Nakamoto consensus: A blockchain consensus mechanism combining proof of
                        work and the longest chain rule to achieve network agreement on the blockchain state. Anyone and
                        everyone will be able to mine Minotari on Day 1 - creating a world where everyone has a voice
                        and an opportunity to participate in the network and shape its future. This accessibility brings
                        a fair distribution that‚Äôs been absent in recent projects. You don‚Äôt need to be an early
                        investor or an airdrop farmer to get XTM; simply contributing raw hash power to the network is
                        enough.

                        Tari miners receive XTM for every block they mine, with block rewards declining on a
                        block-by-block basis. In the first 12 years post-mainnet launch, the Tari emission curve
                        dictates the mining reward. After 12 years, the protocol rewards miners via a tail emission to
                        ensure they receive compensation forever for securing the network. The tail emission increases
                        the XTM emitted by{' '}

                <p>
                    Unlike Bitcoin, which operates on a 4-year halving schedule, the Tari block rewards decrease
                    steadily over time block-by-block through an exponential decay function, halving approximately every
                    three years.

                        Network rewards are split 50/50, with half of the Tari block reward going towards merge mining

                        is a proof of work (PoW) algorithm designed to be ASIC-resistant by optimizing for
                        general-purpose CPUs, ensuring fairer, more accessible, and more decentralized mining. The
                        merge-mining aspect of Tari will enable existing RandomX miners to increase their revenue and
                        keep them successfully mining both the RandomX chain and Tari for the foreseeable future. The
                        Tari protocol bakes this 50/50 distribution into the consensus rules.

                        All dapp (tapp!) activity will occur on the Tari Layer 2 (aka the Ootle), including DeFi, NFTs,
                        SocialFi, GameFi, stablecoins, streaming payments, and more. Tari contributors have designed an
                        elegant relationship between the Layer 1 tokens (XTM) and the Layer 2 tokens (XTR) to offset
                        supply inflation and maintain a soft peg between them. Tari contributors achieve the interplay
                        between the two tokens through a token model called the
                    </span>{' '}

                <p>
                    In the Tari Turbine Model, the only way to create XTR tokens is to burn XTM tokens on the Layer 1
                    and redeem the XTR 1:1 on the Ootle network. As a result, there is a one-way relationship between
                    the two tokens. On the Ootle, a portion of the transaction fee is paid to validators, and a portion
                    of the transaction fee is burned. This token-burning mechanism creates a powerful economic model
                    where Tari miners can confidently secure the network forever, and at scale, the overall Tari token
                    economy achieves circulating supply equilibrium.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <Image src={Image3.src} alt="" />

                <p>
                    The Turbine Model enables Tari to maintain a soft 1:1 peg between Minotari (XTM) and Tari (XTR)
                    without using complicated peg-out mechanisms like drive chains or federated pegs.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other things being equal, greater activity on the Ootle depletes the supply of Tari tokens faster.
                    Mining rewards on the Minotari network in the form of XTM replenishes the supply of XTR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Throttle actively controls the burn rate for XTR associated with every transaction on the Ootle.
                    The Throttle is an algorithm run via consensus by validator nodes that periodically adjusts the burn
                    rate to maintain the stability of the Tari ecosystem. The Throttle has three priorities in
                    decreasing order of importance: to i) maintain the XTM:XTR peg, ii) maintain a stable supply of XTR
                    + XTM, and iii) maintain a total token supply of 21 billion tokens.

                    At the mainnet launch, 756,000,000 tokens will be available for liquidity providers. The balance
                    will be unlocked every month for four years, starting six months after the launch.

                    These tokens will unlock every month for five years, beginning 12 months after the mainnet launch.

                <p>
                    Please note that just because these tokens are unlocked does not necessarily mean they will be
                    circulating. For example, tokens allocated for Protocol Infrastructure and Grants will be unlocked
                    but held back from circulating supply until they can be deployed to improve the usefulness of the
                    Tari network.
