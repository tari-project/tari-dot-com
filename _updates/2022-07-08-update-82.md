Tari's DAN Layer is progressing nicely with a lot of pull requests (PRs) related to checkpoints and committees getting merged this week.

One exciting PR merged this week was [**#4260: Add range proof batch verification to validators**](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues/4260).

More than 80% of CPU time during block sync and verification is taken up by range proof verification. Using a clever trick of using the same cryptographic generators, multiple range proofs can be verified at the same time, dramatically cutting down the time taken in verification.

[Bulletproof+ benchmarks](https://github.com/tari-project/bulletproofs-plus#batched-64-bit-single-range-proof-verification) have shown that range-proof verification gains for an empty block with only two outputs would be around 37%. A slightly more populated block with four outputs gains would be 56%, and then for a densely populated block (256 outputs or more) the gains would approach 80%. Effective speedup of block verification in these three cases would be around 30% for two outputs, around 45% for four outputs and around 64% for 256 outputs or more.

Here's a list of other PRs recently merged:
