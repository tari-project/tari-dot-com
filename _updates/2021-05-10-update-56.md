## Tari Base Node v0.8.10 Released

Tari Base Node v0.8.10 has been released. This is a minor release with some fixes to bugs and possible vulnerabilities.

## Test merge mining pool

A test mining pool has been released at [https://testpool.tari.com/](https://testpool.tari.com/) for testing merge mining with XMR. To connect to it, use the following settings in `xmrig`:

```
 "pools": [
        {
            "url": "testpool.tari.com:5555",
            "user": "<YOUR_TARI_ADDRESS>:<YOUR_STAGE_NET_MONERO_ADDRESS>",
            "pass": "<IDENTIFIER>:<EMAILADDRESS>",
            ...
        }
    ],
```

Choose an identifier and email address. It's still in pre-alpha stage, so email delivery is not guaranteed.

For the testnet Tari, you can get the address from the `Public Key` field on the `Receive` tab of the `tari_console_wallet` or by long pressing on `Copy Emoji ID` on the `My Profile` page of the Tari Aurora mobile apps. In this example, I'll use `1E1CD11B750CD94BDD40916368E1F31119821B8F1B3FE132778B267676C8A955`

You'll need a stagenet Monero wallet address, or you can use the following address: `5AVbkiuchCWiMdF15PzVjsaTtDf8BmG9LQKDEJAdokjuYZJCdJUsoTvDGHMAXcKMhYYvTvQ5y29ozWitA8NECHRsFazgqqz`

For example:

```
 "pools": [
        {
            "url": "testpool.tari.com:5555",
            "user": "1E1CD11B750CD94BDD40916368E1F31119821B8F1B3FE132778B267676C8A955:5AVbkiuchCWiMdF15PzVjsaTtDf8BmG9LQKDEJAdokjuYZJCdJUsoTvDGHMAXcKMhYYvTvQ5y29ozWitA8NECHRsFazgqqz",
            "pass": "testminer:no-reply@example.com",
            ...
        }
    ],
```
