## New testnet launched: Esmeralda

The `dibbler` testnet has been running since January 2022, but there are new features in the development branch that are not in `dibbler`.
Because adding these features to `dibbler` would have required a development heavy hardfork, and we've already successfully tested hardforks in `dibbler`,
the development community decided to save time and create a new testnet instead.

Those features are now significant enough to start testing, and we're proud to annouce a new testnet [Esmeralda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Weatherwax) (Genesis Block is 30 August 2022). For those of you
mining, **Dibbler will continue to run, side-by-side with Esmeralda**. There are still two Lambos up for grabs in the [Tari Testnet Limited store](https://store.tarilabs.com/), which will continue to use `dibbler` tXTR. Just a reminder, these are still testnet coins, and don't have a market value.

To run `esmeralda`, you can either compile from source using the development branch, or [download a binary](https://www.tari.com/downloads/) from the [website](https://www.tari.com/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/releases) with a version `v0.37` or higher. (Dibbler binaries will still be available).

Some of the new features in `Esmeralda`:

- [Bulletproofs+](2022-06-24-update-80) - Bulletproofs, but better. Smaller than regular BPs, and with batch verification of range proofs, full-block validation times are something like 60% quicker. 😮
- [Stealth addresses](2022-08-01-update-84) - Tari brought one-sided payments to Mimblewimble. Stealth addresses make the privacy trade-off much smaller. 🕶️
- Tari 🔥 burn 🔥 transactions. Why would you want to do this? [Find out more](https://github.com/tari-project/rfcs/pull/10)
