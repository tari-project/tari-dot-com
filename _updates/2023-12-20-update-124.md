The Tari core developers have been fighting the good fight on two fronts: wrapping up changes to the Minotari
codebase based on the audit feedback (finished!), and driving towards a Tari network testnet release candidate (soon?).

As usual, the major casualty of an extreme code offensive has been documentation. Today we're happy to announce that
we're setting this straight-- well, straighter, by releasing several new RFC documents that describe the Tari Digital
Assets Network.

Firstly, [RFC-303](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0303_DanOverview.html) has been completely rewritten and updated. It
describes the DAN architecture and how it fits into the Tari ecosystem.

Then, [RFC-350](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0350_TariVM.html) describes the Tari Virtual Machine (TVM) and how it
executes Tari smart contracts.

Then, we dive deeper into the Consensus layer of the DAN with a series of 5 documents, 4 of which are brand new:

- [RFC-305](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0305_Consensus.html) presents the design philosophy and defines the roles of the
  consensus engine.
- Many of you will never have heard of Cerberus, yet it sits at the very core of the Tari network.
  [RFC-330](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0330_Cerberus.html) attempts to explain the fairly complex algorithm
  behind this very novel consensus algorithm in plain English.
- A core part of what makes Tari unique is the dual-layer design to leverage the security and liveness guarantees of
  a proof-of-work blockchain, with the scalability and throughput of the Cerberus BFT consensus algorithm. Getting
  these two layers to play nice so that we can get the best of both worlds is a tricky challenge.
  [RFC-325](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0325_DanTimeManagement.html) covers a proposal for epoch management, our
  favoured idea for aligning the two layers.
- State management is a huge challenge in massively scalable smart contract platforms.
  [RFC-331](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0331_Indexers.html) describes Tari's indexing strategy for retrieving contract
  state from shards reliably and quickly.

We also have some RFC proposals that have entered the implementation phase:

- [RFC-141](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0141_Sparse_Merkle_Trees.html) describes Sparse Merkle Trees as a replacement
  for the somewhat hacky Mutable Merkle Mountain range data structure used to track the UTXO set on the base layer.
  SMTs have already been implemented and are currently being tested in nextnet.
- This is a biggy. [RFC-385](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0385_StableCoins.html) outlines a design for a
  suite of privacy-enabled stablecoins on Tari. Self-sovereign money is one thing, but self-sovereign _private_
  money takes us to the next level. This is still a very early design, but the core devs are already working on an
  early implementation of the design to be ready for the DAN testnet release next year.

## tl;dr

Don't feel like wading through over 20,000 words of new documentation? No worries, mate.

We've printed it all out on environmentally friendly, 100% recycled virtual paper and dumped it in
[Tari Bot's](https://rfc.tari.com) lap, told it to memorise it all, cancelled its Christmas leave and made
it work 24-hour shifts answering all the questions the community has about the DAN. You're very welcome, and _boas
festas_!
