## Emoji set changes

We've merged changes into the core emoji set! The reasons for this are:

- Some emoji weren't supported on older Android devices.
- A few emoji have issues when being copied / pasted into common chat apps.

The set we've now proposed has been thoroughly tested and has minimal issues in most common chat apps.

### So what does this mean?

It means your emoji ID is going to change. _Sorry._ 😿

But nothing else really changes, and nothing really breaks.

Here's why:

Your emoji id is an encoding of your node or wallet id on the network. The underlying node id isn't going to change (unless you re-install the app from scratch), just its
representation.Think of it like this - If you use Google to translate what you ate for breakfast from English to Portuguese, the words on the screen change, but the underlying
meaning hasn't changed. That's basically what this emoji set update represents.

So this means that you keep your testnet funds, and everything works as before. You contacts will automatically update to reflect their new emoji ids too.

In fact, the only thing that _won't_ work is if you paste an emoji id into your wallet that was copied from an older version of the app, and vice versa. And even if _that_ happens,
the new version of Aurora will detect the older format and warn you about it.

### What's actually changing?

Ok, so here are the emojis that have been _removed_ (131 in total). If they aren't displaying on your device properly as you read this, you'll understand why they were removed:

```text

```

These are newly introduced into the set (131 in total):

And these are unchanged (125 in total):

```

### When will this happen?

These changes will be introduced in the next minor release of the mobile (0.2.0) and base node (0.4.0) apps and we'll let you know when those drop so that everyone can upgrade
expeditiously; most likely late next week, but we'll keep you posted.

## Stress testing - part II

The developer community ran a second testnet stress test this week. (Say that 10 ten times quickly).

The test dumped 48,000 transactions onto the Tari network in the space of a few minutes. Things went much better than the first test (that test amounted to a self-inflicted DDoS
attack):

- A large majority of transactions got signed and broadcast.
- A majority of transactions were broadcast on the network, with mempools filling up nicely.
- Nodes did not fail under intense memory or CPU consumption, and blocks were successfully propagated through the network.

Even though this was a vast improvement over the first test, the results are still not where we want them to be. If you're interested in the technical _minutae_, you can jump into
\#tari-dev and follow the conversation there.

The good news is that the remaining problems are somewhat self-evident. Several core contributors have already started to address those issues and we are hoping to see further
massive improvements in the next stress test.

### Reminder - Telegram discussion this Friday

The Tari community will be discussing the Proof of Work for mainnet this friday. Join us and make your voice heard.

Friday, June 12th @ 16:00 UTC (9:00 PDT, 12:00 EDT, 17:00 CET, 18:00 SAST) on Telegram or #Tari on Freenode\* to discuss the proof-of-work algorithm for Tari.

\*There is a bridge routing messages from either platform to each other
