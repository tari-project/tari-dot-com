It's been a while since the last developer update. But that's not because development has eased up. There are a few
_yuge_ updates and features in the works, but they're taking a little longer to get out the door than was originally
anticipated.

The various contributors have been in their hovels / burrows / cages (I assume that's where developers live) putting on
the final touches to these big new features:

- New emoji set (we discussed this quite a bit in the
  [last update](https://www.tari.com/updates/2020-06-10-update-23.html)).
- Aurora wallet backups and restores, for both Android and iOS. Yup, your tXTR are still worthless, but 1,500,000 x 0 is
  better than 0 x 0 for some people.
- Low Power mode for Aurora Android. Yes! You asked for it, the mobile contributors are delivering!
- More efficient block propagation between nodes (reducing block-related bandwidth up to 90% in some cases).
- Not enough?

![Are you not ENTERTAINED?!](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/a5/a53f26725588e6f02eee7fd1275ee15d869f44ff1f56c4ff27d2c9e97b4205dd.jpg)

- Well how about pruned mode? Pruned mode dramatically reduces the amount of data needed for initial block download when
  starting up a fresh node. The pruned mode sync implementation is about 80% done.
- Oh wait, there's more! I don't want to give the game away, but it rhymes with "rock hack sporer".
