## Testnet SHA mining pool

The development community has set up a test SHA3 mining pool at [https://miningcore.tarilabs.com/](https://miningcore.tarilabs.com/). See [here](https://github.com/tari-project/tari#tari-sha3-mining) for instructions on setting up the `tari_mining_node` to mine against it.

## Tari Base Node 0.9.5

Tari base node and console wallet v0.9.5 have been released. This version includes minor fixes, but mainly fixes a regression caused by v0.9.4 that caused nodes to get into an invalid state after a reorg.

Binaries are available on the [download page](https://www.tari.com/downloads/)

Please note that all base nodes should delete their database and resync the blockchain as part of this update.
