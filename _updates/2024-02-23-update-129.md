We're pleased to announce a few big updates in Tari's documentation efforts.

## Tari Aurora

First up, [@NovaT82](https://github.com/NovaT82) has put together the first series of videos walking you through the
functionality of the Tari Aurora wallet.

You can see the video catalogue on the [Tari Aurora site](https://aurora.tari.com/videos/).

This first set of videos focuses on the bare essentials of sending and receiving Tari, as well as connecting a Yat
to your wallet.

Future videos will explore some of the lesser-known features of the wallet, including UTXO (e-note) management,
back-ups, and bug reporting.

## Tari Launchpad

We've also been working on the Tari Launchpad documentation.

The [Tari Launchpad guide](\launchpad-guide) has been updated in the last week. Aaaand... we added a video that gets
you going with Tari mining in under (almost) five minutes!

Check it out [in the launchpad guide](\launchpad-guide), or from our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjcsEiAtr9mC1Yt0uJ-3xA).
